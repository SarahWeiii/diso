# Differentiable Iso-Surface Extraction Package (DISO)
This repository consists of a variety of differentiable iso-surface extraction algorithms implemented in `cuda`.

Currently, two algorithms are incorporated:
* Differentiable **Marching Cubes** [1] (DiffMC)
* Differentiable **Dual Marching Cubes** [2] (DiffDMC)

The differentiable iso-surface algorithms have multiple applications in gradient-based optimization, such as shape, texture, materials reconstruction from images.

# Installation
Requirements: torch (must be compatible with CUDA version), trimesh
```
pip install diso
```

# Quick Start
You can effortlessly try the following command, which converts a sphere SDF into triangle mesh using different algorithms. The generated results are saved in `out/`.
```
python test.py
```

Note:
* `DiffMC` generates guaranteed watertight manifold meshes w/ or w/o grid deformation.
* `DiffDMC` generates watertight manifold meshes when grid deformation is disabled. When enabling grid deformation, self-intersection may occur, but the face connectivity remains manifold.
* `DiffDMC` can produce a more uniform triangle distribution and smoother surfaces than `DiffMC` and supports generating quad meshes (in the example, the quad is automatically divided into two triangles by `trimesh`).

# Usage
All the functions share the same interfaces. Firstly you should build an iso-surface extractor as follows:
```
from diso import DiffMC
from diso import DiffDMC

diffmc = DiffMC(dtype=torch.float32).cuda() # or dtype=torch.float64
diffdmc = DiffDMC(dtype=torch.float32).cuda() # or dtype=torch.float64
```
Then use its `forward` function to generate a single mesh:
```
verts, faces = diffmc(sdf, deform)  # or deform=None
verts, faces = diffdmc(sdf, deform)  # or deform=None
```

Input
* `sdf`: queries SDF values on the grid vertices (see the `test.py` for how to create the grid). The gradient will be back-propagated to the source that generates the SDF values. (**[N, N, N, 3]**)
* `deform (optional)`: (learnable) deformation values on the grid vertices, the range must be [-0.5, 0.5], default=None.  (**[N, N, N, 3]**)

Output
* `verts`: mesh vertices within the range of [0, 1]. (**[V, 3]**)
* `faces`: mesh face indices (starting from 0). (**[F, 3] for DiffMC, [F, 4] for DiffDMC**)

The gradient will be automatically computed when `backward` function is called.

# Speed Comparison
We compare our library with DMTet [3] and FlexiCubes [4] on two examples: a simple round cube and a random initialized signed distance function.

The algorithms have been rigorously tested on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Each algorithm underwent 100 repeated runs, and the table presents the time and CUDA memory consumption for **a single run**.
